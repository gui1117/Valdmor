CPPN.js
=======

Node module for Compositional Pattern Producing Networks, now in a javascript library near you!

Tests are run through Mocha and should.js. Activation functions and cppns are tested against the HyperNEAT C# code from Sebastian Risi's work.

This library is used by the neatjs library and the winjs library as well, usually as an NPM module -- but can be used inside HTML.

(links to follow someday...)

Usage: 

var cppnjs = require('cppn');
